Fortunately, putting a stop to a leaky faucet, such as the compression faucet in your kitchen, can be surprisingly inexpensive and simple.</p><a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary" data-slide-to="1" href="#faucetCarousel">What You Need <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span></a></div></div><div class="item"><div class="card"><img src="images/faucet_2.jpg" alt="Tools you will need" class="img-responsive img-circle"><h1>Tools You Will Need</h1><ul><li>Adjustable wrench; C wrench</li><li>Phillips and/or flat-head screwdriver</li><li>Penetrating oil, such as WD-40 or CRC</li><li>Replacement washers and O-rings</li></ul><a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary" data-slide-to="2" href="#faucetCarousel">Lets Get Started! <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span></a></div></div><div class="item"><div class="card"><img src="images/faucet_3.jpg" alt="Step 1" class="img-responsive img-circle"><h1>Step 1</h1><p>Don't make a mess worse by transforming your broken faucet into Old Faithful. Before applying any wrench or screwdriver to your fixture, make sure your water supply is turned off, from the handles over the sink to the knobs underneath that control the water coming in from the main line.</p><a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary" data-slide-to="3" href="#faucetCarousel">Next Step <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span></a></div></div><div class="item"><div class="card"><img src="images/faucet_4.jpg" alt="Step 2" class="img-responsive img-circle"><h1>Step 2</h1><p>Remove any decorative parts of the handle knobs. A simple prying with a flat-head screwdriver will take care of that. Underneath each knob, there will be a screw that mounts the handle to the stem. Unscrew, then gently remove the handle with your flat-head. Using penetrating oil can assist in loosening it, allowing you to take the fau handle off the stem.</p><a href="#faucetCarousel" class="btn btn-lg btn-primary" data-slide-to="4">Next Step <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span></a></div></div><div class="item"><div class="card"><img src="images/faucet_5.jpg" alt="Step 3" class="img-responsive img-circle"><h1>Step 3</h1><p>Use your wrench to loosen the packing nut. From there you should notice the stem. Remove that as well. Depending on the faucet, some stems pop right off, while others twist off from the valve. Check the removparts for any damage.</p><a href="#faucetCarousel" class="btn btn-lg btn-primary" data-slide-to="5">Next Step <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span></a></div></div><div class="item"><div class="card"><img src="images/faucet_6.jpg" alt="Step 4" class="img-responsive img-circle"><h1>Step 4</h1><p>If everything is intact at this point, inspect the O-ring and washer inside the valve seat—they could be the reason for your leak. Remove the washer and put a replacement inside the seat.</p><p>It's crucial to make sure your replacement washers and O-rings are an exact fit. If you are unsure about either, check the seat to see if the sides fit a cone-shaped or flat washer, and purchase the appropriate type. You may want to take the old O-ring to your local hardware store to verify the correct size. You can also buy a package including many different sizes of O-rings—sometimes it's wo the extra few bucks.</p><a href="#faucetCarousel" class="btn btn-lg btn-primary" data-slide-to="6">Next Step <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span></a></div></div><div class="item"><div class="card"><img src="images/faucet_7.jpg" alt="Step 5" class="img-responsive img-circle"><h1>Step 5</h1><p>From here, carefully reassemble all the parts (in order of washer/O-ring, stem, packing nut, screw, and handle). Slowly and gently turn the knob to test the running water and check to see if we've licked that leak.</p><a href="#faucetCarousel" class="btn btn-lg btn-success" data-slide-to="0">Your Done!</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="footer"><p>♥ from Baltimore</p></div></div><script src="scripts/vendor.js"></script><script src="scripts/plugins.js"></script><script src="scripts/main.js"></script></body></html>
